          Given an array of integers numbers, find the first Index i for which
          three consecutive elements numbers[i], numbers [i + 1], and numbers [i

          the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not
          worse than o(numbers.length²) will fit within the execution time

          When i0 the triple (numbers [0], numbers [1], numbers [2]) = (0, 1,

            [15:10, 9/24/2024] Vivek Diwakar: There is a network with N roads
            and N + 1 cities. The cities are labeled with distinct integers
            within the range [0..N]. Roads connect the cities in such a way that
            there is exactly one way to travel between any two of the cities. In
            other words, the network forms a tree. The roads in the network are
            too narrow to accommodate two cars. For this reason, every road
            (that connects cities A and B) is oriented in one of two possible
            ways: either from A to B, or from B to A. If the road is oriented
            from A t&B, then every car traveling from B to A has to give way to
            cars traveling from A to B. This, naturally, makes traveling from A
            to B much faster than traveling from B to A. A big hospital was
            recently founded in the city labeled 0. F… [15:11, 9/24/2024] Vivek
